Python implementation of estimators taught in AÃ˜KA08084U Advanced Microeconometrics at University of Copenhagen, see: https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%c3%98ka08084u/2021-2022. Most of the code is taken and reused from exercise classes but some functionality has been added and I have restructured the code to follow a more object oriented approach with a similar experience as packages like Statsmodels or linearmodels. 

Each estimator is a class and is structured as:

1. Linear panel models
    1. Pooled OLS
    2. Fixed Effects
    3. First Difference
    4. Random Effects
2. High dimensional models
3. Non-linear models
