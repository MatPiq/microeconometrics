Python implementation of estimators taught in AÃ˜KA08084U Advanced Microeconometrics at University of Copenhagen, see: https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%c3%98ka08084u/2021-2022. Most of the code is taken or reused from exercise classes but some functionality has been added and I have restructured the code to follow a more object oriented approach with a similar experience to packages like `Statsmodels` or `ScikitLearn` with a `.fit()` and `.predict()` method for example. Implemented estimators are:

1. `Linear panel models`
    1. `Pooled OLS`
    2. Fixed Effects
    3. First Difference
    4. Random Effects
2. High dimensional models
3. Non-linear models
